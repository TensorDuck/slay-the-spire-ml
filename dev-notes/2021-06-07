# Playtest

Overall, did better than I thought it would. Ironclad (no ascension) made it to heart
but failed to kill the heart using the recommended cards. This demonstrates the power of
data at the very least.

Below are some specific notes on improvements/changes.

## UI
* Add 3-4 columns for cards * Simplify text, i.e. "strike number:" -> "strike:"
* Increase visibility on cards - don't display cards that have a recommendation of 0.
* Add feature that displays the score of three specific cards - i.e. during the game the
  player often only has a choice between 3 cards (sometimesmore, but rarely)

## Predictions
* Add methods for inferring the total number of desired cards. Prevents decks from
  getting too big
* Seems like card removal is hard to gauge. I.e. it's hard to figure out if I need to
  remove the extra strikes or defends.
* I'm guessing that methods like cosine distances and matrox factorization heavily
  weight towards whats in the deck. Thus, it typically recommends decks that don't have
  the card removed. Need to find a way to account for that.
